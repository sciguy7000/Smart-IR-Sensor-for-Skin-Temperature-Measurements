# Smart-IR-Sensor-for-Skin-Temperature-Measurements
Skin temperature is widely used as a method of screening people for fever to prevent infected people entering a space. Our aim in this project was to create a device that could automatically read skin temperature from a person standing in front of the device and display those readings. We used an 8x8 infrared array, the Sparkfun Qwiic GRIDEye Infrared Array (AMG8833) to develop a prototype. Since this module runs on 3.3V we also needed a logic level converter to interface it with the 5V Arduino board which was used to send data to a PC via the serial port. Processing open-source software was used to convert the data from an array of temperature readings into a heatmap image. We experimented with different algorithms to automatically determine if a person was correctly centered in front of the IR camera so that the forehead area could be identified. We found a neural-network based approach called a Perceptron worked best for this process.
